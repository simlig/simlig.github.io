            <h4>
                Senior Design - VineTech: 2022-2023
            </h4>

            <p>
                My team of 4 other Computer Scientists took over a project designed to predict the yield of grapes
                months before harvest from a specific section of <a href="https://www.crawfordbeck.com/">The Crawford Beck Vineyard</a>. Previous teams and faculty
                had successfully achieved accurate predictions using an autonomous rover and computer vision,
                but there were several issues that still had to be addressed. First, we were responsible for correcting
                the inaccurate bay assignments littered throughout the database by utilizing an HMM model paired with a
                Computer Vision algorithm written by a professor that correctly identified when a post was within a photo.
                This fixed several terabytes of image data and significantly increased the accuracy of the yield prediction.
                Our second responsibility was to implement cruise control for the autonomous rover. To accomplish this goal,
                we needed to fix the motor encoders, as they possessed largely inconsistent values. Once this was achieved,
                we deciphered the value of the encoder after one second and used this value as our goal.
                Every millsecond, the ROS (Robot Operating System) checked the current encoder value and modified its speed
                to match the value. Finally, we were responsible for implementing autonomous turning for the rover, as the
                previous team had created the ability for it to drive within the vineyard rows, but upon reaching the end,
                it would simply cease moving. We incorported the rover's GPS to capture the most recent longitude and latitude
                values to determine the direction of the turn and then utilized LIDAR to determine how to turn around specific
                objects.

                I developed a mobile application for iOS and Android titled 1075 Mobile, by use of the Delphi
                programming language. This application enables propane drivers to view customer, tank, and appliance information
                by using the REST paradigm to interact with a Paradox database. Additionally, it allows for transactions,
                safety checks and GPS routing to be performed in the field. This experience helped me to develop my skills as a
                front-end developer and granted me increased familiarity with the steps required to successfully launch
                a mobile application on the Amazon and Apple App Stores.

                I assist and encourage students to reach their academic goals by teaching them core Computer Science concepts
                and empathizing with them when they fall short of those goals. Key concepts conveyed are data structures,
                analysis of algorithms, parallel programming paradigms, relational databases, front-end design, and programming
                style best practices.

                Hoping to assist with the refugee crisis on the beautiful Mediterranean island of Lesvos,
                my inter-discipline team brainstormed ways that we could bring sustainable income to the island.
                After months of researching a variety of factors, such as likelihood of cultural acceptance, cost,
                and environmental impact, we discovered the blue-green algae Spirulina. Spirulina is a resource 
                deeply ingrained within the culture and a procurer of countless health benefits. 
                I was responsible for deciphering the logistics of the farming process, such as the growing conditions,
                cultivation, production, harvesting and cost, as well as for the post-processing methodology
                for a mid-sized facility. The project culminated in several members of our team traveling to Lesvos and 
                displaying our work to interested Lesvos residents. The presentation was a resounding success, as the project
                was given authorization to proceed with the designing and constructing of a Spirulina facility on the island.

            <p>
                Tasked with exploring the history, syntactic and semantic structure of a programming language, I chose
                the language TypeScript. This language was developed by Microsoft and has seen significant use and support
                since its inception, primarily because of its sustainability and sustainability compared to vanilla
                JavaScript. The full report can be accessed via this <a href="CSIS420 - Research Paper.pdf" target="_blank">

                Pandemic2020 - Software Engineering: Spring 2020
            </h4>

            <p>
                Seeking a high-level solution to the global pandemic, my team and I developed the idea for a mobile application
                dubbed Pandemic 2020. Pandemic 2020's purpose would be to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by developing an
                early warning system through the use of contact tracing, daily checkups and regulation notifications.
                In this document, we discuss the intended audience, use, risks, and dependencies required for this application
                to exist, as well as the basic UI elements. The culmination of the project was a presentation before
                a mock board of directors comprised mainly of university faculty. The final PDF can be found at this
                <a href="Pandemic2020.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>.
