            <h3>
                Senior Capstone Project - VineTech: 2022-2023
            </h3>

            <p>
                The VineTech project has has existed since 2016 and its goal is to utilize a series of machine learning
                algorithms to accurately predict the yield of <a href="https://www.crawfordbeck.com/">The Crawford Beck Vineyard</a>
                several weeks or months before harvest. This is important for vineyard owners, because without an accurate prediction
                of yield, hundreds of pounds of grapes would be wasted. Last year, Crawford Beck reported their estimate to be 72% accurate,
                while the VineTech estimate had an estimate of 98% accuracy.

                When our team took over the project, we had three major goals
                to accomplish: fix the inaccurate bay assignments in the database in order to increase our predictions,
                implement adaptive cruise control so that the rover would maintain a constant speed regardless of topography
                and implement autonomous turning, so that the rover could navigate itself autonomously through the vineyard, instead
                of just a singular row.

            <p>
                Our specific vineyard was separated into 21 rows, each with 21 bays. Bays are separated from one another by a metal post.
                The first image is an example of such a metal post from the rover's view. The middle image is an example
                of our spreadsheet detailing the weights collected during harvest. After each harvest, the spreadsheet
                is taken and the weights recorded are associated with the images from that specific bay. This allows us to start making
                predictions based upon previously recorded images and weights. When these images are incorrectly labeled, 
                it makes the predictions remarkably less accurate. The harvest season is typically in the early fall/late summer timeframe,
                which means we are taking most of our vineyard images in the summer, during higher temperatures. Unfortunately, the official max operating
                temperature of our GoPro GPS modules are approximately 95 degrees Fahrenheit, so there are times when we exceed that temperature while taking
                photos and our GPS meta data becomes inaccurate as a result.

                The two images shown here are some example plots from our validation scripts. These images are showing the GPS data recorded by each image with
                latitude on the x-axis, and the longitude running along the y-axis. The first image depicts a day in early June, where the GPS data is fairly accurate.
                The last image depicts a day in late August with a much higher temperature. This increase in temperature resulted in what we called “GPS drift”,
                which gave us incredibly inaccurate coordinates.

                What this allows us to do is quickly glance at each day and determine the accuracy of how well we determined the row and bay numbers.

                As a result of these data visuals, we determined that we needed a new way of assigning the row and bay numbers for each image. To do this we used a "post tagger". 
                Our "post tagger" is a machine learning algorithm that (given some good test-data) is able to determine if a metal posts is in the image. This is used in conjunction
                with the timestamp data from each image to map an image to a particular bay. After doing this, we achieved an approximate accuracy of 96%. 
                This 4% of error can be for a variety of reasons, but the most likely is that it saw a post for another bay through the vines as shown on the last image.

                </a>


            <p>
                To address the accuracy issues with the “post-tagger”, we developed a Hidden-Markov Model that given the output of our post prediction model, is able to perform some
                pattern matching to determine if there was a false negative or a false positive. This is done by providing the model with a “typical pattern”, which can be mathematically
                determined based upon the total number of images for that given day. This was incredibly successful and allowed us to correct the 2019 and 2020 datasets, and with a little
                bit of work, next years team should be able to quickly implement this for 2021, 2022, and by that point 2023 data as well. Additional work is necessary because the rover images
                are formatted differently, so the image timestamps and other metadata from the new image structure will need to  be determined.

                Goal 2: Implement Adaptive Cruise Control
            </h3>

            <p>
                By comparing the current number of wheel rotations against an ideal number of wheel rotations in a given amount of time, we could decipher how we need to modify our speed 
                in order to meet our ideal speed. This was achieved by using the rover's motor encoders, but we quickly that the encoders provided inconsistent readings depending on the speed. 
                At slower speeds, it was completely accurate, but upon speeding up, the motor encoders would become inconsistent. With these inconsistent readings, it became impossible to 
                utilize the motor encoders to solve this solution. This knowledge caused us to shift our solution to incorporate the rover's GPS. This process worked similarly to how the motor
                encoders calculated speed, but instead of utilizing wheel rotations, we utilized previous and current GPS coordinates.

                Because we do not have a vineyard at George Fox University, we set up partitions in the Maker Hub to simulate vineyard rows.
                In this image, the rover autonomously navigated itself to the end of the simulated row and simply stopped when it could no
                longer see any rows on either side of it.

            <p>
                This is how the rover views the LiDAR data. The box in the middle is the rover and the clusters on either side are the rows.
                The rover determines these clusters by using a machine learning algorithm called a Gaussian Mixture Model, which takes the amount
                of clusters to look for and then automatically deciphers the best clusters from the data provided. Using this method, the rover can
                decipher where the majority of points lie in relation to itself, which is useful for deciding when to turn.
            </p>

            <br>


            <p>
                Once the majority of points are behind the rover, that means it has reached the end of a row. It then algorithmically determines
                a pivot point, which will be the end of the row for whichever side the rover is turning towards. In this example, that pivot point
                is the green circle that represents the end of the right row.
            </p>

            </a>

            <br>


            <p>
                During a turn, the rover utilizes the pivot to adjust its angle based upon its distance from that point. After both rows are once again
                visible, the rover ceases to turn and continues to intelligently navigates itself down the row.
            </p>

            <br>
                
            <p>
                In this successful turn, we can see the rover reach the end of a row, pick its pivot, adjust its turning angle based upon that pivot and,
                once it can perceive both sides of a row again, continue intelligently navigating forward to its next goal.

                I developed a mobile application for iOS and Android titled 1075 Mobile using the Delphi
                programming language. This application enables propane drivers to view customer, tank, and appliance information
                by using the REST paradigm to interact with a Paradox database. Additionally, it allows for transactions,
                safety checks and GPS routing to be performed in the field. This allows the employees to utilize their phones to perform
                their tasks, instead of having to utilize onboard laptops or pen and paper. Besides development, I was responsible
                for communicating with employees about desired features and support. Another aspect of my role was
                publishing the application to both the Amazon and Apple App Stores. This process included icon design, supplying example
                images, writing a privacy policy and verifying that the application met every appstore criteria.

            <p>
                Hoping to assist with the refugee crisis on the beautiful Mediterranean island of Lesvos,
                my inter-discipline team brainstormed ways that we could bring sustainable income to the island.
                After months of researching a variety of factors, such as likelihood of cultural acceptance, cost,
                and environmental impact, we discovered the blue-green algae Spirulina. Spirulina is a resource 
                deeply ingrained within the culture and a procurer of countless health benefits. 
                I was responsible for deciphering the logistics of the farming process, such as the growing conditions,
                cultivation, production, harvesting and cost, as well as for the post-processing methodology
                for a mid-sized facility. The project culminated in several members of our team traveling to Lesvos and 
                displaying our work to interested Lesvos residents. The presentation was a resounding success, as the project
                was given authorization to proceed with the designing and constructing of a Spirulina facility on the island.

                information by using the Python library BeautifulSoup to scrape the information from a series of HTML files
                on the internet. After correctly extracting the data, we inserted it into our database and were given a total
                of 23 queries to answer. These queries ranged in difficulty, such as simple select statements from entities,
                to the use of recursion across a multitude of tables. The full report for the project can be acccessed

            </h3>

            <p>
                Seeking a high-level solution to the global pandemic, my team and I developed the idea for a mobile application
                dubbed Pandemic 2020. Pandemic 2020's purpose would be to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by developing an
                early warning system through the use of contact tracing, daily checkups and regulation notifications.
                In this document, we discuss the intended audience, use, risks, and dependencies required for this application
                to exist, as well as the basic UI elements. The culmination of the project was a presentation before
                a mock board of directors comprised mainly of university faculty. The final PDF can be found at this
