    <h1>Why I Love These Songs</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Come Back To Us</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>1917 is a movie about World War 1 and it is extremely graphic with its depiction of the source material. This song really conveys the melancholy and loss that comes from war, but it also gives an inkling of a brighter future on the horizon.</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Time</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>Inception is a movie about a lot of things, but one primary theme is time. This song channels that theme and conveys the importance of how we use our time. We never know how much we have left.</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>The Breaking Of The Fellowship</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>The title of this song really does a great job of explaining the emotions that are evoked. To me, its about how people go their separate ways in life. How friends we've known for years might no longer be around us anymore. There is a sadness, but there is also a hope that one day we might see those friends again.</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>May It Be</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>This song plays perfectly off of the previous song, as it speaks to the times in our lives where we feel alone. Its a hope that we can fight through those tough times and into a better stage of life.</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Into The West</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>I was once told that this song was sung at a funeral. It was the father's wish for his son to sing it for him. I think it helps to inject a feeling of hope into what is an incredibly depressing circumstance.</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Into The Unknown</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>Subnautica is a video-game almost entirely taking place in the water on an alien planet. This song helps to encourage a sense of adventure, but also forboding, as the player submerges deeper and deeper into the depths...</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Below Zero</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>Subnautica: Below Zero is the sequel to Subnautica and contains the same premise, except the ocean is glacial. I love how the music almost conveys the twinkling of icicles and the echos of ice tunnels. Very atmospheric!</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Elder Scrolls - Skyrim: Far Horizons</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>To be brief, Skyrim is a video-game set in a fantasy world. It has magic, dragons and more often than not, truly beautiful sights. This music helps to convey those moments of beauty and awe.</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Around the Fire</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>To be honest, I just really love the sound of this music!</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Battlefield One</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>Battlefield 1 is a game that is set in World War 1. Much like 1917, it is graphic in its depiction. Its not something that I've personally experienced, but this music really conveys in me the resolve it takes to fight in war. It has this constant beat, almost as if its  building up towards an inevitable battle, but there is a somberness conveyed with the violins. Almost as if what the cost will be is known, but there is resolve to continue anyway.</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Now That This Old World Is Ending</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>Far Cry 5 is a game based in Montana and it has some truly breathtaking scenery. This music focuses in on those moments and helps one to appreciate the beauty that surrounds them. It makes me think about how easy it is to tarnish that beauty in our narrow-minded pursuits. Perhaps this Old World Is Ending...</div></li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>When The Morning Light Shines In</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><div>This song conveys much of the same emotions as the previous entry in this list. I suppose I just have a love for violins!</div></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
