<title>"Choose Your Adventure!</title>
<body>
    <h1>Choose your own adventure!</h1>
    <p id="replace">
        In life, no matter how many times we try to convince ourselves differently, there is always a choice.
        Now, just because there is a choice doesn't mean that it is ideal or that we will in anyway
        enjoy those that we decide upon. This is a simple exercise to illistrate this idea.

        <br>
        <br>

        You find yourself on a long journey to the other side of the country and find yourself having to make a choice
        between two branching paths. Unfortunately, you must make the choice without knowing the path that lies ahead
        or what obstacles you might encounter...
